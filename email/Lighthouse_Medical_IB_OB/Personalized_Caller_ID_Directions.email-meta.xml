    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Account},

We look forward to setting up your personalized caller ID, so that the calls and texts generated from our system will show your office phone number.

This process will require a few steps to complete:

1. We will need to call you to do the verification of your number. If you would like a specific date and time, please reply back to this email.
2. Once we have verified your number, you will receive an email to authentication we have permission to finish set up.

Subject: Hosted SMS Letter of Authentication (LOA) Signature Required

Sender: Hello Sign (below is an example of what the email will look like)

Note: Please provide the electronic signature as soon as possible. This email agreement expires in seven days. Without the signature, we are unable to complete set up.

1. Once we have received your e- signature, it can take up to two days to finish set up.
2. You will will receive an email communication from us when your number has been successfully completed.

Thank you for choosing Lighthouse. We appreciate your business!

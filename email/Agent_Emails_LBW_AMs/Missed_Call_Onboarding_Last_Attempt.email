<![CDATA[<font size="2" face="Arial,Sans-Serif">Hi [FIRST NAME],<br><br>I've been reaching out to you over the past several days but haven't been able to reach you to complete your onboarding call for your new Lead Stream account. I wanted to send you this email today to let you know that your account is active, your leadsite is launched at [DOMAIN], and your ads are running. You can login to your dashboard by visiting dashboard.web.com and using your email address as the username. We'd love to review this with you. If you could give us a call back we can complete the onboarding call. <br><br>Soon, your account manager will reach out to you to discuss your accounts performance so far and any opportunities for improvement. We are looking forward to working with you more. <br><br>Thank you for choosing Web.com. We appreciate your business!<br><br>[Signature] </font><br>]]></td>

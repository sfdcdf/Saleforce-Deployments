<![CDATA[<font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hi&nbsp;{!Account.Client_First_Name__c},<br><br>I
 wanted to reach out to you regarding a recent email lead that came in 
off of your website. It appears you replied back to Yodle on this last
 lead instead of to the potential customer.&nbsp; This is no big deal but I
wanted to bring it to your attention so you have the best chance to get 
in touch with this customer.&nbsp; <br><br>In the future when responding to Yodle 
email leads, you don't need to hit the reply button.&nbsp; Instead, be sure 
to create a new email and send it to the customer's email address 
directly.&nbsp; I've included the potential customer's information for you 
below so that you can resend your response.<br><br><em><span style="">(<span style="background-color: #FFFF00;">insert lead email address, phone number &amp; message</span>)</span></em><br><br>I hope this lead works out for you!&nbsp; As always, if you have any further 
questions, you can reach us at&nbsp;(877) 334-4321. Thanks again for your 
business and have a great day!<br><br>Sincerely,<br><i style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><br></i></font><div><div><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>{!User.Full_Name__c}</b></font><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Yodle Customer Care</font></div><div><font size="2" face="Arial, sans-serif">(877) 334-4321</font></div><br><br><br></div>]]></td>

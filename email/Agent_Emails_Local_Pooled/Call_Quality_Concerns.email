<![CDATA[<font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hi&nbsp;{!Account.Client_First_Name__c},<br><br>Yodle’s
 main goal is to bring you calls and emails from people in your area, 
looking for the services you provide. &nbsp;While we have made your business much more 
accessible to potential new customers online, you may sometimes see calls that are less 
relevant.<br><br>We do everything we can to reduce these, but the occasional wrong number
 or hang up is unavoidable when your information is on the internet. I'll continue to monitor the quality of your calls so that we can 
take steps to improve the leads you receive.<br><br>In the meantime, the best way to help is to login to your <a data-cke-saved-href="https://live.yodle.com/" href="https://live.yodle.com/" target="_blank">Yodle Platform</a> and rate your leads. This will help us make the appropriate adjustments to your campaign.<br><br>If
 you have any questions, we’re available to discuss your account over 
the phone. You can reach us at (877) 334-4321. Thanks again for your 
business and have a great day!<br><br>Thank you!<br><br></font><div><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>{!User.Full_Name__c}</b></font><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></div><div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Yodle Customer Care</font></div><div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font size="2" face="Arial, sans-serif">(877) 334-4321</font></div>]]></td>

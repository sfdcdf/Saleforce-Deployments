    <textOnly>Hi,

Yodle’s self-service dashboard allows you to monitor and track all aspects of your online advertising campaign.  I wanted to provide you a brief overview of the tools and functionality available to you within your Yodle Dashboard.

LOGIN:
To begin, go to the login page at www.yodlelive.com.

HOME SCREEN:
The home page provides a summary of your overall presence online and what you can do to improve. At the top you’ll see status updates on the strength of your web content and growth of your social presence.  You’ll also notice that we’ve set goals for you to achieve for receiving reviews and adding contacts.  Reaching these milestones will give you the best chance for success. We will periodically have suggestions that can help you get the most from your account.  When this happens, we’ll let you know with the “Take Action” box located in the middle of the page. If we need you to submit us your PIN, there will be a message in here as well.

LEADS:
From the leads tab, you are able to review all contacts that we have generated to you.  The top of the page will show you the total number of leads you’ve received broken down by either Organic visits or Ads visits.  Below that, you can find a detailed breakdown of all of your leads.  By clicking on a lead, you can review information such as their name, phone number or email address. You can also click the play button to listen to the recording of that phone call.  Be sure to rate your leads after reviewing them.  Our analyst team will use this information to keep your account heading in the right direction.

CONTACTS:
On the Contacts tab you can see how to manage your customer list in our platform.  Think of this page as your online address book.  You can store your new and existing customers’ contact information.  Once entered, you can track the history of their calls, emails, and even sales. Storing contacts also allows you to solicit online reviews from your customers though the dashboard.

REVIEWS:
From this page Yodle allows you to request and monitor customer reviews submitted through the Rate-A-Biz site.  You can email your customers asking them for a rating and write up about their experience with your business directly from your dashboard. Positive reviews help you show up more often online and help you stand out in comparison to your competitors. You’ll have a higher likelihood of receiving calls if you have the better online reputation.

SOCIAL:
This tab will allow you to simplify the management of your social presence. Here you can sync your existing Facebook business page or create a new one. This allows you to expand your reach by posting messages, photos, or special offers directly from your dashboard.

WEB:
On the web tab, you can monitor the number of visitors that are coming to your website.  We track the visitors based on how they found you. You’ll notice areas highlighting clicks from Organic, clicks from Ads &amp; clicks from Other sources like our directories.

PHOTOS:
Here, we give you the ability to upload photos to be featured on the website and across 30+ directories such as Google+ and Yahoo Local. This can be a picture of your work, employees, or office. Unique photos will improve your online presence and can increase the number of people who visit your site and contact your business. Make sure you regularly update photos of your office, staff, or recent jobs to keep your content fresh.

EMAIL MARKETING:
The email marketing page allows you to easily create and send messages to your contact list.  You can choose to send an email from one of our master template or create your own from scratch.  You’ll be able to choose your layout, recipient list, and date of send.  Staying in front of your customers with periodic updates is a great way to stand out from your competition.

OFFERS:
This tab gives you a simple way to create and post offers to your site and 50+ directories. You can track the effectiveness of your offer by monitoring views, prints and claims all through your dashboard.  Clients who include an offer, regardless of how small it might be, have a better chance at attracting customers so be sure to login and create one.

ORGANIC:
Within the organic section of the dashboard, you can view and track the progress we are making in getting you found on the search engines.  You can find the number of leads and clicks generated by organic searches at the top. Below that you will notice a tab that says Search Engine Rankings. Clicking this tab will display all of the keywords that your website is ranking for on the search engines.  Remember that organic performance can take up to 60 days to ramp up, so check back often to see how you’re progressing.

ADS:
The ads tab will show you the results of your sponsored advertising campaign.  These are the ads that show up at the top and right hand side of the search engines.  You will notice at the top, we outline the number of leads and clicks that have been generated so far through these ads.  Below the graph, you will find this information broken down by Ad Campaign.  You can come here to view which campaigns are currently running, how many clicks they are generating and what our best performing ad is.

GET IN TOUCH:
We know that from time to time you may have questions when you’re in the dashboard and we’re here to help!  From within the dashboard, simply click on the Get in Touch tab.  Select what your question is about from the dropdown menu, type in a short message, and then hit send.  This message will come directly to us.  We know your questions are important, so we’ll be sure to get back in touch with you within 24 hours.

That wraps up the main areas you can find in your Yodle Dashboard.  If you have questions about how to use the dashboard, what information is accessible in there, or anything else regarding your account please don’t hesitate to reach out.  You can always reach us by phone, email or from the Get in Touch screen of the dashboard.  Have a great day!

Thank you,</textOnly>

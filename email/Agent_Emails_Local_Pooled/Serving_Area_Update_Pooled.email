<![CDATA[<font face="Arial,Sans-Serif" size="2">Hi&nbsp;{!Account.Client_First_Name__c},<br><br>We can certainly talk about how we can try to get you found in <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(larger metro)</span>
 but I wouldn’t recommend changing the serving area we have listed on 
the site right now.&nbsp; Since Google is focused on a local experience for 
its users, we want to start by optimizing your website for the city and 
state you are located in.&nbsp; As your site gains credibility, you will 
begin ranking in both the organic and maps sections for, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(current metro)</span>.&nbsp; You typically need a strong presence in your main city before growing to surrounding areas like <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(larger metro)</span>. <br><br>If
 we were to try and target <i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">(larger metro)</i> immediately, you wouldn’t show
 in the maps section there and it would take an extremely long time to 
get found for important keywords, which is something we don’t want.&nbsp; But
 I can assure you that we’re not just targeting <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(current metro)</span>,&nbsp; You will still be attracting customers from outside the area, it’s just important that you build a solid foundation in <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(current metro)</span>
 first. I do have a suggestion that I think could help though.&nbsp; If 
you’d like, we can add language to your website that increases your 
service area across the county/region your business is in- this can 
expand the area you get found in. <br><br>If you’re interested in generating business from 
outside of your area more immediately, you can always target that <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(larger metro)</span> with our paid ad campaign.<br><br><br></font><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><div><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>{!User.Full_Name__c}</b></font><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Yodle Customer Care</font></div><div><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">(877) 334-4321<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;</span></font></div></div><br>]]></td>

    <textOnly>Hi,

Your team at Yodle began the setup of your Maps profile pages today, a key feature of your online marketing package.  Within the next two to four weeks, please be on the lookout for a postcard from Google.  It will contain a PIN code that we need in order to get your business ranked as high as possible, as fast as possible.

Once you receive this postcard, please reply to this email or call us at 1-888-384-8322 and provide the PIN code. If you are sending the PIN code by email, please be sure to include your business name and your account number, {!Organic_Analysis__c.Client_ID__c}.

The Google postcard is being sent to:
{!Organic_Analysis__c.G_Address_for_Postcard__c}


Google will only send this information to you as the business owner and we need it to finish things up on our end, so please keep a close eye out for it. They look a lot like junk mail! 

Thanks!

Yodle Maps Optimization Team

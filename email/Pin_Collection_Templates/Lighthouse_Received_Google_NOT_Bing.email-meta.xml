    <subject>Lighthouse Needs Your Bing Pin Number</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

Your team at Lighthouse has received your Google PIN code.  Thank you very much for sending it to us!  This code allowed us to successfully claim and verify your Google Places profile, but we still need your Bing PIN number in order to complete the setup of your Bing Business profile page.

We requested Bing send this postcard on, {!Organic_Analysis__c.B_Postcard_Request__c}, to the address below:

{!Organic_Analysis__c.B_Address_for_Postcard__c}

If you are unable to receive mail at this address please let us know immediately so that we can begin the process of correcting your information within this search engine. They usually arrive in 7-10 days, but can take as long as three weeks.  Please be on the lookout and contact us when it arrives.

Once you receive the postcard, please reply to this email with the PIN number or call 888-427-5454.  If replying by email, please include your business name and account number {!Organic_Analysis__c.Client_ID__c}.

Bing will only send this information to you as the business owner and we need it to finish things up on our end, so please keep a close eye out for it, they look a lot like junk mail.



Thank you!

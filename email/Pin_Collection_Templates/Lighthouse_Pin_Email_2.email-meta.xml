    <textOnly>Hello,

Our team at Lighthouse recently began the setup of your Maps profile pages, a key feature of your package.  In order to finish things up on our end, we need an important piece of information from you.  By now you should have received two separate postcards from Google and Bing. Each contains a PIN code that we need in order to get your business ranked as high as possible, as fast as possible.

If you have received these postcards, please reply to this email or call us at 888-427-5454 and provide both PIN codes.  If you are sending the PIN codes by email, please be sure to include your business name.  If you have not yet received these postcards, please be on the lookout and contact us when they arrive.

The Google postcard is being sent to:

{!Organic_Analysis__c.G_Address_for_Postcard__c}

The Bing postcard is being sent to:

{!Organic_Analysis__c.B_Address_for_Postcard__c}

Please understand, for security purposes, Google and Bing will only send the card(s) to the address which they have on file.  This means if you are unable to receive mail at the address(s) listed above, please contact us immediately so that we can take steps to correct the information these search engines have on file for your business.


Thank you!

Hello {!Account.00N60000002KwJ5} -

Welcome to the 2013 COLEMAN Liberties Website Program! Below you will find highlights of the program. A 2013 Liberties website welcome kit providing more program information is also attached and can be downloaded at www.upgnet.com &gt; Marketing Center &gt; Dealer Website Program.

Website Improvements

Over the upcoming weeks we will be making the following improvements to your 2012 dealer site. During this time your site will remain live on the web.

Easy-to-use tools that allow you to add local promotions
A mobile-friendly version of your site to leverage the growing shift to mobile devices
Additional customization options
Yodle&apos;s Outrank Program included at no additional cost

These updates will be completed in approximately 2-3 weeks and a Yodle support team member will contact you to schedule a time to review them in more detail. During that call, you will also learn how to customize your site. In the meantime, please visit your dealer website and confirm your business information. If you need to make changes, please email us at jciwebsites@yodle.com.

Outrank

Outrank is a convenient, easy-to-use online marketing solution that ranks your dealer website on page one of top search engines, driving more calls and emails to your business. In addition to placement, Outrank also assists with reputation management through the following features:

Pictimonial - A simple to use app for Android, iPhone and iPad that allows you to get customer testimonies in 4 easy steps
Reputation Monitoring (Available to U.S. locations only.) - This valuable service allows you to see what is being said about your business on the web and by whom

Outrank includes maps listing claiming on major search engines to increase your exposure on the web and build credibility. Before Yodle can optimize your maps listing, you will receive a postcard from major search engines like Google with a unique verification number. Once you receive these postcards, please contact Yodle with the verification numbers so we can complete your maps set up. Maps verification is a crucial part of optimization that prevents others from changing your maps listing without your confirmation. This process will be reviewed in more detail on your call.

If you have any concerns or prefer not to utilize Outrank, please email jciwebsites@yodle.com within the next seven business days.

We look forward to a successful year!

Sincerely,
JCI Website Support

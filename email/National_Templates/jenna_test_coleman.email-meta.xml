Hello -

Welcome to the 2013 COLEMAN Liberties Website Program! Below you will find highlights of the program. A 2013 Liberties website welcome kit providing more program information is also attached and can be downloaded at www.upgnet.com &gt; Marketing Center &gt; Dealer Website Program.

Website Creation

To start the website development process, click the link below where you will be directed to choose from five design templates and provide additional business information needed to build your new website.

http://www.colemandealersite2013.com/

Within 14 days of you completing this step, your new site will be launched.  In the weeks after the launch of your site, a Yodle support team member will contact you to schedule a time to review the program features in more detail.  During that call, you will also learn how to customize your site.

Outrank

Outrank is a convenient, easy-to-use online marketing solution that ranks your dealer website on page one of top search engines, driving more calls and emails to your business. In addition to placement, Outrank also assists with reputation management through the following features:

Pictimonial - A simple to use app for Android, iPhone and iPad that allows you to get customer testimonies in 4 easy steps
Reputation Monitoring (Available to U.S. locations only.) - This valuable service allows you to see what is being said about your business on the web and by whom

Outrank includes maps listing claiming on major search engines to increase your exposure on the web and build credibility. Before Yodle can optimize your maps listing, you will receive a postcard from major search engines like Google with a unique verification number. Once you receive these postcards, please contact Yodle with the verification numbers so we can complete your maps set up. Maps verification is a crucial part of optimization that prevents others from changing your maps listing without your confirmation. This process will be reviewed in more detail on your call.

If you have any concerns or prefer not to utilize Outrank, please email jciwebsites@yodle.com within the next seven business days.

We look forward to a successful year!

Sincerely,
JCI Website Support

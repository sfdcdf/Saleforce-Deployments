Hello {!Account.00N60000002KwJ5} -

We have just launched your new COLEMAN dealer website and the Outrank program!

Now you have the ability to customize your dealer site.  These customizations include things like:

Adding your company logo, testimonials and &quot;About Us&quot; information
Promotions
Additional services
Adding pictures

The Outrank Product will allow us to help optimize your site so that people can easily find you on the Web!  In order to do this, a representative from Yodle will be reaching out to give you more details on Maps Optimization.  Outrank includes maps listing claiming on major search engines to increase your exposure on the web and build credibility. Before Yodle can optimize your maps listing, you will receive a postcard from major search engines like Google with a unique verification number. Once you receive these postcards, please contact Yodle with the verification numbers so we can complete your maps set up. Maps verification is a crucial part of optimization that prevents others from changing your maps listing without your confirmation. This process will be reviewed in more detail on your call.

A representative from Yodle will be reaching out to you within the next 7 business days to confirm your information and share more information on Outrank and the pin collection process!

Please note that the phone number on your website is a Yodle call tracking number. When someone calls the call tracking number they will be automatically routed to your phone. In the Yodle Dashboard you will be able to listen to all calls that have come to your business via the website.  In addition, you should have received another email from jciwebsites@yodle.com which contains your website URL and access information for your Yodle Dashboard.  If you have not received this information or need help logging in, email us at jciwebsites@yodle.com or call at 866-607-4050.

Welcome to the 2013 Liberties Website Program!

Sincerely,
JCI Website Support

Hello {!Account.00N60000002KwJ5} -

We have successfully updated your YORK dealer website for our 2013 program to include a new promotions feature. In addition to this update, you have the ability to customize your dealer site.  These customizations include things like:

Adding your company logo, testimonials and &quot;About Us&quot; information
Promotions
Additional services
Adding pictures

Per your request we have disabled the Outrank optimization program.  Just as a reminder, this program is included at no additional cost.

Outrank is a convenient, easy-to-use online marketing solution that ranks your dealer website on page one of top search engines, driving more calls and emails to your business. In addition to placement, Outrank also assists with reputation management through the following features:

Pictimonial - A simple to use app for Android, iPhone and iPad that allows you to get customer testimonies in 4 easy steps
Reputation Monitoring (Available to U.S. locations only.) - This valuable service allows you to see what is being said about your business on the web and by whom

If you would like to have us add any of the additional website customization options or the Outrank optimization strategy to your dealer website, please email us at jciwebsites@yodle.com or call at 866-607-4050.

In addition, you should have received another email from jciwebsites@yodle.com which contains your website URL and access information for your Yodle Dashboard.  If you have not received this information or need help logging in, email us at jciwebsites@yodle.com or call at 866-607-4050.


We look forward to a successful year!

Sincerely,
JCI Website Support

Hello {!Account.00N60000002KwJ5} -

We have successfully updated your YORK dealer website for our 2013 program to include a new promotions feature. In addition to this update, you have the ability to customize your dealer site.  These customizations include things like:

Adding your company logo, testimonials and &quot;About Us&quot; information
Promotions
Additional services
Adding pictures

Now that Outrank is included in the Liberties Website Program, you will no longer be billed for this service by Yodle. Yodle will continue to optimize and maintain your site, but no further charges will be incurred by you.

If you would like to add customizations to your dealer site, please contact us at jciwebsites@yodle.com or call 866-607-4050.  Please reference the dealer website welcome kit for more information.

In addition, if you do not remember your login information or website URL, please email us at jciwebsites@yodle.com or call at 866-607-4050.

We look forward to a successful year!

Sincerely,
JCI Website Support

    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Client_First_Name__c},

As noted below, to accept the terms and conditions of this Change Order, please reply to this e-mail with &quot;Accept&quot; in the body.
 
This Change Order changes the Agreement in effect between Yodle and Customer.

If at least one (1) of the Keywords does not appear on the first page of Google search results within the first 90 days of the Yodle Organic Service Commitment Period (the “Guarantee Period”), then Customer may terminate the Yodle Organic Service by e-mail to Customer’s Interactive Marketing Specialist within 10 days after the end of the Guarantee Period.

Except as modified by this Change Order, all of the terms and provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. 

This Change Order becomes effective on the date accepted by Customer. Customer accepts this Change Order by replying to this e-mail with “Accept”. This action creates an electronic signature that has the same legal force and effect as a handwritten signature on a written contract under any applicable law or regulation, and is equally binding.

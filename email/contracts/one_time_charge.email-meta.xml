The Customer agrees that its Yodle Live monthly advertising budget is increased on a one-time basis by {!Case.Budget__c}, and Customer authorizes Yodle to charge its credit card for this amount, effective immediately.

Except as modified by this Change Order, all of the terms and provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect.

    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Client_First_Name__c}, 

	This email is to confirm you are changing your budget and extending your contract with Yodle. 

As noted below, to accept this Change Order, please reply to this e-mail with &quot;Accept&quot; in the body. 

This Change Order changes the Agreement currently in effect between Yodle and Customer, as set forth herein. 

The Customer agrees that its Yodle Live monthly advertising budget is changing from {!Case.Old_Budget__c} to {!Case.Budget__c}, and Customer authorizes Yodle to charge its credit card for the amount of the change for the current billing cycle, effective immediately.

The Term set forth on the Order Form will be extended for an additional {!Case.Term_months__c} months, and the Agreement is not cancellable by Customer during the Term. In consideration for Customerâ€™s agreement to the Term extension, Yodle will provide Customer with a one-time advertising credit calculated as 20% of the difference between your new monthly advertising budget of {!Case.Budget__c} and the old monthly advertising budget of {!Case.Old_Budget__c}. 

Except as modified by this Change Order, all of the terms and provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. 

Customer accepts this Change Order by replying to this e-mail with &quot;Accept&quot;. This action creates an electronic signature that has the same legal force and effect as a handwritten signature on a written contract under any applicable law or regulation, and is equally binding. 

Please contact your Yodle sales representative if you have any questions. 

Sincerely,

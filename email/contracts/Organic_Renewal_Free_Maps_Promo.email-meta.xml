    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Client_First_Name__c}, 

This email confirms that you are extending the Commitment Period of your Yodle Organic Service (the “SEO Commitment Period”) by an additional {!Case.Term_months__c} months (the “Extension Period”) and adding optimization of two (2) additional keywords. As noted below, to accept this Change Order, please reply to this e-mail with &quot;Accept&quot; in the body.
 
This Change Order changes the Agreement currently in effect between Yodle and Customer, as set forth herein. 

The SEO Commitment Period is extended by an additional {!Case.Term_months__c} months, and the term of your Yodle Organic Service will continue month to month thereafter until the Agreement is terminated or the Yodle Organic Service is cancelled. Customer may not cancel the Yodle Organic Service during the SEO Commitment Period.
 
The Yodle Organic Service will be changed to add the optimization of two (2) additional keywords. As a result of this change, the Yodle Organic Service includes the optimization of five (5) keywords. 

In addition, in consideration for Customer renewing the SEO Commitment Period of its Yodle Organic Service prior to August 1, 2010, the Yodle Organic Service will include the Maps Optimization Feature effective as of the first day of the Extension Period at no additional charge, The Maps Optimization Feature is designed to help Customer’s business listing appear in what is known as of the date of this Change Order as the “Google 7-pack results” in response to searches for Customer’s optimized keywords. Customer acknowledges that search results are influenced by several factors, and Yodle cannot guarantee any placement or particular position or rank for Customer’s business listing. 

The monthly fee for the Yodle Organic Service, as amended by this Change Order, will be {!Case.Budget__c} per month effective as of the first day of the Extension Period. 

Except as modified by this Change Order, all of the terms and provision of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. 

Customer accepts this Change Order by replying to this e-mail with “Accept”. This action creates an electronic signature that has the same legal force and effect as a handwritten signature on a written contract under any applicable law or regulation, and is equally binding. 

Please contact your Yodle sales representative if you have any questions. 


Sincerely,

    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Client_First_Name__c},

As noted below, to accept this Change Order, please reply to this e-mail with &quot;Accept&quot; in the body. 

1.	Display Advertising. Display advertising is an additional means to generate clicks as part of the Yodle Sponsored Service (the “Display Advertising Service”). Customer’s Monthly Advertising Budget for the Display Advertising Service will be used as a result of clicks on Customer’s display Ads. Customer may also choose to purchase creative Services in connection with its display Ads. The options and prices for creative Services are set forth below. Customer will only be deemed to have purchased a creative Service if a one-time fee for such Service is set forth in Section 4 of this Change Order.

The minimum term of the Display Advertising Service is {!Case.Term_months__c} months, commencing on the date Yodle begins to distribute Customer’s display Ads (the “Display Advertising Service Commitment Period”), and the term will continue month to month thereafter (and Customer will be billed the applicable monthly fees on a monthly recurring basis) until the Agreement is terminated or Customer cancels the Display Advertising Service. Customer may not cancel the Display Advertising Service during the Display Advertising Service Commitment Period.

3.	Display Advertising Monthly Advertising Budget. Customer’s Monthly Advertising Budget for the Display Advertising Service, which is in addition to Customer’s existing Monthly Advertising Budget for the Yodle Sponsored Service, is ${!Case.KeyWord_2__c} (calculated as {!Case.Budget__c} x {!Case.Days_Live__c} accounts). Customer’s Monthly Advertising Budget for the Display Advertising Service is a separate Monthly Advertising Budget that will be used for clicks on Customer’s display Ads.

{!Case.Old_Budget__c} for creative Services - PLATINUM Package

Except as modified by this Change Order, all of the terms and provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. 

This Change Order becomes effective on the date accepted by Customer. Customer accepts this Change Order by replying to this e-mail with “Accept”.

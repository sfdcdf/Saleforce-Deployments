The determination as to whether a Qualified Lead has been provided is in Yodle’s reasonable discretion.

2. The price for each Qualified Lead is {!Case.Budget__c}.

3. Except as modified by these Additional Terms, all of the terms and provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect.

4. Customer accepts these Additional Terms by replying to this e-mail with &quot;Accept&quot;. This action creates an electronic signature that has the same legal force and effect as a handwritten signature on a written contract under any applicable law or regulation, and is equally binding.

    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Client_First_Name__c}, 

	
This email confirms that Customer is adding the maps optimization feature (described below) to its Yodle Organic Service and is extending the Commitment Period of the Yodle Organic Service to the date that is six (6) months after the Maps Optimization Effective Date (defined below), as set forth herein. As noted below, to accept the terms and conditions of this Change Order, please reply to this e-mail with &quot;Accept&quot; in the body. 

This Change Order changes the Agreement currently in effect between Yodle and Customer.

Yodle will add the maps optimization feature to Customer’s Yodle Organic Service effective as of the first day of Customer’s next billing period (the “Maps Optimization Effective Date”). The maps optimization feature is designed to help Customer’s business listing appear in what is known as of the date of this Change Order as the &quot;Google 7-pack results&quot; in response to searches for Customer’s optimized keywords. Customer acknowledges that search results and search engine rankings are influenced by several factors, and Yodle does not guarantee any placement in the &quot;Google 7-pack results&quot; or a particular position or rank for Customer’s website or business listing in any search results. 

The Commitment Period of Customer’s Yodle Organic Service is extended through the date that is six (6) months after the Maps Optimization Effective Date. 

As of the Maps Optimization Effective Date, Customer’s monthly Yodle Organic Fee will increase by $170.00. 

Except as modified by this Change Order, all of the terms and provision of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. 

This Change Order becomes effective on the date accepted by Customer. Customer accepts this Change Order by replying to this e-mail with “Accept”. This action creates an electronic signature that has the same legal force and effect as a handwritten signature on a written contract under any applicable law or regulation, and is equally binding. 
Please contact your Yodle sales representative if you have any questions.
 

Sincerely, 

Yodle Contracts Team

    <subject>Yodle Organic Services - Please &quot;Accept&quot;</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Client_First_Name__c}, 

This email confirms that Customer is adding the Yodle Organic Service to its Services, as set forth herein. As noted below, to accept the terms and conditions of this Change Order, please reply to this e-mail with &quot;Accept&quot; in the body. 

This Change Order changes the Agreement in effect between Yodle and Customer and becomes effective on the date accepted by Customer (the “Effective Date”). 

The Yodle Organic Service. The Yodle Organic Service includes the optimization of three (3) keywords, the application of “on page” and “off page” search engine optimization tactics to Customer’s website and optimization for Customer&apos;s business listing in Google maps/places. Customer may purchase additional keywords as part of its initial purchase under this Agreement or thereafter pursuant to a Change Order. To the extent its website is not hosted on Yodle’s servers, Customer will provide access to its website to enable Yodle to perform the Yodle Organic Service. Customer acknowledges that search results and search engine rankings are influenced by several factors, and Yodle does not guarantee any placement, position or rank for Customer’s website or business listing in any search results. 

Yodle Organic Service Commitment Period. The minimum term of the Yodle Organic Service is {!Case.Term_months__c} months, commencing on the Effective Date (the “Yodle Organic Service Commitment Period”), and the term will continue month to month thereafter (and Customer will be billed the applicable monthly fees on a monthly recurring basis) until the Agreement is terminated or Customer cancels the Yodle Organic Service. Customer may not cancel the Yodle Organic Service during the Yodle Organic Service Commitment Period. 

Fees. Customer agrees to pay the additional monthly fee for the Yodle Organic Service, which is {!Case.Budget__c} per month, effective as of the Effective Date.

Except as modified by this Change Order, all of the terms and provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. 

Customer accepts this Change Order by replying to this e-mail with “Accept”. This action creates an electronic signature that has the same legal force and effect as a handwritten signature on a written contract under any applicable law or regulation, and is equally binding. 

Please contact your Yodle sales representative if you have any questions.
 

Sincerely, 

Yodle Contracts Team

    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.Client_First_Name__c},

I tried giving you a call today to discuss your Yodle account but I wasn&apos;t able to reach you.  I need to speak with you as soon as possible.

You currently have an outstanding balance of (unpaid balance), which is 30+ days past due.  Your account has been cancelled due to non-payment. The outstanding balance from the (insert invoice date) invoice is the final payment needed to close the account in good standing.

Please call me at (877) 334-4321 so we can take care of your past due balance to prevent any further collection activity on your account. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

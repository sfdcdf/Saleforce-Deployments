    <textOnly>Dear {!Lighthouse_Worksheets__c.Practice_Name__c},

We are reaching out regarding your Lighthouse account. We are no longer receiving communication from your Chirotouch PMS and as a result are not seeing changes to your patients and appointments.

To help us get your office back in sync we need you to please contact Chirotouch support and request a Release of Liability form then fill it out and send back to them. Once they receive the form you will be provided a username and password. Once you have that please contact us with that information so we can get you back in sync.

If you have any questions please contact us. Thank you for choosing Lighthouse. We appreciate your business.

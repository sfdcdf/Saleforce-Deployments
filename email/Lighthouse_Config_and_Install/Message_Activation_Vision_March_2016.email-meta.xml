It will take a few days for any emails and text messages to queue up. While we are in the process of ramping up these messages and confirmations, please continue to confirm appointments as you normally have. Your task list in your portal will be a valuable tool for you to assist you in confirming your appointments. If you have another reminder service, now is the time to request they discontinue notifying your patients..

    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

How are you?  Hope you had a great week and have some fun plans for the weekend!

I’m hoping you and I can set aside some time to chat in the next week or two. I’d love to discuss the following:

Lighthouse + {!Account.Name} partnership so far
Accomplishments
What went well?
What could we have done better to support you?

Game plan for next few months
What are your major initiatives for April &amp; 2nd quarter?
How can we support {!Account.Name}?
Marketing
Sales rep incentives
Sales goals for Q2

New Lighthouse team member
I’d also like to introduce you to another team member we have now at Lighthouse, Artie! He will be a great additional resource for you.

Please let me know what your calendar is like next week.  To see my calendar and just schedule something directly just go here: https://calendly.com/kshianna/connect Looking forward to it!

    <textOnly>Hi {Client_First_Name__ },



We are now past the May 31st deadline to comply with recent changes made by Google regarding SSL certificates that mark the websites as secure in a web browser. To ensure your website has an SSL certificate installed, we need you to take the following steps as soon as possible:


Speak with your technical team to gather all DNS records you need transferred to our systems.

Send an email with all of this information listed to support@torchx.com. If you prefer, you can also take a screenshot of your DNS settings page and attach that to the email you send.

Wait for us to add those records and then confirm with you once we’re done.

From there, you can then make the name servers change. Do NOT do this before we have given you the OK, as this could impair functionality on the backend and cause downtime.


For more information, please review the previous email we sent titled, “ACTION REQUIRED: Secure Your TORCHx Website.” You can also give us a call at 1 (888) 428-9659.  We&apos;re available Monday - Friday from 8:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m. EST


Thank you for choosing TORCHx. We appreciate your business!

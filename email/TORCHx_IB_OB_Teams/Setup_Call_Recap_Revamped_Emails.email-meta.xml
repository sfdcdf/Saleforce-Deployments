    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.Client_First_Name__c},

Welcome to TORCHx! I want to thank you again for taking the time to speak with me today. Here&apos;s a quick outline of what we&apos;ll be working on over the next few days and the deliverables we need from you in order to proceed.



What we&apos;ll do:

Establish the framework for your new website, which takes about a week depending on your MLS
Create additional landing pages for each target area provided
Enter provided brokerage and personal information

What we need from you:

Complete and sign the MLS listing application once you have it.  After it’s complete, send it our way so we can sign it as well. Remember, we can’t launch your site until you turn this back in. Completing this step quickly can help you qualify for a $200 pay per click ad credit!
Gather your existing lead list and assemble any other content for your profile page.

If you’d like to get a head start on training or just want an overview of the build process overall, please visit: INSERT SINGLE PAGE LINK


Our next training call is scheduled for INSERT DATE AND TIME


If you have any additional questions, feel free to give us a call at

1 (888) 428-9659.  We&apos;re available Monday - Friday from 8:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m. EST


Thank you for choosing TORCHx. We appreciate your business!

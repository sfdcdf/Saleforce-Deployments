    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.Client_First_Name__c},


Now that your site is live, we&apos;d like to review with you some of the more advanced features that were not previously available.  


You really don&apos;t want to miss this session, so give us a call back at (888) 428-9659 as soon as you can so we can complete the session.  We&apos;re available Monday-Friday, 8:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m. EST


If you haven&apos;t already, I would also encourage you to check out our online learning center and TORCHx 101 Webinar.

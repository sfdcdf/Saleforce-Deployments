    <subject>ACTION REQUIRED: Secure Your TORCHx Website</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer,


In order to comply with changes that are being made by Google with regard to SSL certificates that mark the website as secure in a web browser, we are making adjustments to our systems. As of May 31st, 2018 your domain name will need to be pointed to the TORCHx name servers in order to take advantage of SSL. In order to help you with this change, below we have provided several links to the most popular domain registrars. However, if you do not find yours on the list, please contact your domain registrar directly.



Name Server 1: ns4a.dns-host.com
Name Server 2: ns4b.dns-host.com



Before you make this change you will need to confirm that all of your additional DNS records are transferred to our systems. To accomplish this task, send an email to support@torchx.com with the records you need us to add. This process normally takes 2 business days to complete, at which time we will inform you that you are clear to make the change.

The most common of these is the record that controls your email known as the MX record. Since your domain is setup unique to your business, you will want to consult your technical team before making any changes.

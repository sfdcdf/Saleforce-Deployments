    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Hello. This email is to confirm you are extending your contract with Yodle.

As noted below, to accept this Change Order, please reply to this e-mail with &quot;Accept&quot; in the body.

This Change Order changes the Agreement currently in effect between Yodle and Customer, as set forth herein.

Customer agrees that the Length of Contract (the ”Initial Term”) set forth on the Order Form will be extended for an additional {!Lead.Secondary_Segments__c} months. In consideration for Customer’s agreement to the Initial Term extension, Yodle will provide Customer with a {!Lead.Description} at the budget of ${!Lead.Vertical__c}/mo.

Except as modified by this Change Order, all of the terms and provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect.

Customer accepts this Change Order by replying to this e-mail with &quot;Accept&quot;. This action creates an electronic signature that has the same legal force and effect as a handwritten signature on a written contract under any applicable law or regulation, and is equally binding.

Please contact your Yodle sales representative if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Yodle

    <textOnly>Hi {Client_First_Name__ },

We have some great news! We’re beginning the MLS integration phase of your TORCHx website!

Please note we are still awaiting your {completed IDX paperwork and/or MLS approval},  but in the meantime here’s what we will be working on.

What we&apos;ll do:

Begin connection with the MLS database, which contains all of the properties we list on your website.
Pull in any properties you wish to have displayed on the site.
Remove any properties you do not wish to display.
Transfer from the test site URL over to {INSERT CLIENT&apos;S PERMANENT DOMAIN}. You can still login at any time using the same credentials previously provided.

If you have any additional questions, feel free to contact us at

1 (888) 428-9659.  We&apos;re available Monday - Friday from 8:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m. EST

You can find 24/7 support here.

Thank you for choosing TORCHx. We appreciate your business!

    <textOnly>Hello {!Lighthouse_Worksheets__c.Practice_Name__c},

Thanks for taking the time to review your account with us today.  We&apos;re glad we could help you get started and want to make sure you have everything you need to get more customers and more revenue for the shop.  Here&apos;s a quick recap of the highlights of your {!Lighthouse_Worksheets__c.Bolt_On__c} account.

Shop Operations

We&apos;ve installed our ProPack tools directly on the shop&apos;s workstations.  You can use these features to automate lube sticker appointments, send text reminders and approval messages to your customers, and create custom invoices.  Try to get in the habit of using these every day.

You&apos;ll also have access to our digital inspection product which ties in to the ProPack tools.  Once your tablets are set up your techs can complete digital inspections in the bay, and instantly communicate the results to service writers and customers for less paperwork AND easier upselling!

<![CDATA[<font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hi&nbsp;{!Account.Client_First_Name__c},<br><br>Yodle’s
 self-service dashboard allows you to monitor and track all aspects of 
your online advertising campaign.&nbsp; I wanted to provide you a brief 
overview of the tools and functionality available to you within your 
Yodle Dashboard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><b>LOGIN:</b><br>To begin, go to the login page at <a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.yodlelive.com" href="http://www.yodlelive.com" target="_blank">www.yodlelive.com</a>.<br><br><b>HOME SCREEN:</b><br>The
 home page provides a summary of your overall presence online and what 
you can do to improve. At the top you’ll see status updates on the 
strength of your web content and growth of your social presence.&nbsp; You’ll
 also notice that we’ve set goals for you to achieve for receiving 
reviews and adding contacts.&nbsp; Reaching these milestones will give you 
the best chance for success. We will periodically have suggestions that 
can help you get the most from your account.&nbsp; When this happens, we’ll 
let you know with the “Take Action” box located in the middle of the 
page. If we need you to submit us your PIN, there will be a message in 
here as well.<br><br><b>LEADS:</b><br>From the leads tab, you are able 
to review all contacts that we have generated to you.&nbsp; The top of the 
page will show you the total number of leads you’ve received broken down
 by either Organic visits or Ads visits.&nbsp; Below that, you can find a 
detailed breakdown of all of your leads.&nbsp; By clicking on a lead, you can
 review information such as their name, phone number or email address.&nbsp; 
You can also click the play button to listen to the recording of that 
phone call.&nbsp; Be sure to rate your leads after reviewing them.&nbsp; Our 
analyst team will use this information to keep your account heading in 
the right direction.<br><br><b>CONTACTS:</b><br>On the Contacts tab you 
can see how to manage your customer list in our platform.&nbsp; Think of this
 page as your online address book.&nbsp; You can store your new and existing 
customers’ contact information.&nbsp; Once entered, you can track the history
 of their calls, emails, and even sales. Storing contacts also allows 
you to solicit online reviews from your customers though the dashboard.<br><br><b>REVIEWS:</b><br>From
 this page Yodle allows you to request and monitor customer reviews 
submitted through the Rate-A-Biz site.&nbsp; You can email your customers 
asking them for a rating and write up about their experience with your 
business directly from your dashboard. Positive reviews help you show up
 more often online and help you stand out in comparison to your 
competitors. You’ll have a higher likelihood of receiving calls if you 
have the better online reputation.<br><br><b>SOCIAL:</b><br>This tab 
will allow you to simplify the management of your social presence. Here 
you can sync your existing Facebook business page or create a new one. 
This allows you to expand your reach by posting messages, photos, or 
special offers directly from your dashboard.<br><br><b>WEB:</b><br>On 
the web tab, you can monitor the number of visitors that are coming to 
your website.&nbsp; We track the visitors based on how they found you.&nbsp; 
You’ll notice areas highlighting clicks from Organic, clicks from Ads 
&amp; clicks from Other sources like our directories.<br><br><b>PHOTOS:</b><br>Here,
 we give you the ability to upload photos to be featured on the 
website. 
This can be a picture of your work, employees, or office. Unique photos 
will improve your online presence and can increase the number of people 
who visit your site and contact your business. Make sure you regularly 
update photos of your office, staff, or recent jobs to keep your content
 fresh.<br><br><b>EMAIL MARKETING:</b><br>The email marketing page 
allows you to easily create and send messages to your contact list.&nbsp; You
 can choose to send an email from one of our master template or create 
your own from scratch.&nbsp; You’ll be able to choose your layout, recipient 
list, and date of send.&nbsp; Staying in front of your customers with 
periodic updates is a great way to stand out from your competition.<br><br><b>OFFERS:</b><br>This
 tab gives you a simple way to create and post offers to your site. You can track the effectiveness of your 
offer by monitoring views, prints and claims all through your 
dashboard.&nbsp; Clients who include an offer, regardless of how small it 
might be, have a better chance at attracting customers so be sure to 
login and create one. &nbsp;<br><br><b>ORGANIC:</b><br>Within the organic 
section of the dashboard, you can view and track the progress we are 
making in getting you found on the search engines.&nbsp; You can find the 
number of leads and clicks generated by organic searches at the top.&nbsp; 
Below that you will notice a tab that says Search Engine Rankings.&nbsp; 
Clicking this tab will display all of the keywords that your website is ranking for on the search engines.&nbsp; Remember that organic performance
 can take up to 60 days to ramp up, so check back often to see how 
you’re progressing.<br><br><b>ADS:</b><br>The ads tab will show you the 
results of your sponsored advertising campaign.&nbsp; These are the ads that 
show up at the top and right hand side of the search engines.&nbsp; You will 
notice at the top, we outline the number of leads and clicks that have 
been generated so far through these ads.&nbsp; Below the graph, you will find
 this information broken down by Ad Campaign.&nbsp; You can come here to view
 which campaigns are currently running, how many clicks they are 
generating and what our best performing ad is.<br><br><b>GET IN TOUCH:</b><br>We
 know that from time to time you may have questions when you’re in the 
dashboard and we’re here to help!&nbsp; From within the dashboard, simply

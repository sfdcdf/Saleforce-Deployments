<![CDATA[<font face="Arial,Sans-Serif" size="2">Hello <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(client name)</span>,<br><br>We can certainly talk about how we can try to get you found in <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(larger metro)</span>
 but I wouldn’t recommend changing the serving area we have listed on 
the site right now.&nbsp; Since Google is focused on a local experience for 
its users, we want to start by optimizing your website for the city and 
state you are located in.&nbsp; As your site gains credibility, you will 
begin ranking in both the organic and maps sections for, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(current metro)</span>.&nbsp; You typically need a strong presence in your main city before growing to surrounding areas like <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(larger metro)</span>. <br><br>If
 we were to try and target (larger metro) immediately, you wouldn’t show
 in the maps section there and it would take an extremely long time to 
get found for important keywords, which is something we don’t want.&nbsp; But
 I can assure you that we’re not just targeting <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(current metro)</span>,&nbsp; You will still be attracting customers from outside the area, it’s just important that you build a solid foundation in <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(current metro)</span>
 first.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do have a suggestion that I think could help though.&nbsp; If 
you’d like, we can add language to your website that increases your 
service area across the county/region your business is in – this can 
expand the area you get found in.<br><br>If you’re interested in generating business from 
outside of your area more immediately, you can always target that <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">(larger metro)</span> with our paid ad campaign.<br><br><br></font><div><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Customer Support</b></font></div><div><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OutRank by Rogers</b></font></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">(866) 269-1710</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">outranksupport@service.rogersoutrank.com</span></div><br>]]></td>

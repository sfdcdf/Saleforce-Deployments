He told me that we would need two or three drivers to keep up with them. I asked him if I had introduced myself to him. He told me that I wasn't Superman and one person couldn't handle this job. I told him that I would be waiting on them and they wouldn't have to wait on me and you will eat those words at the end of\r\n the day.. With a smart ass commit he said we will see. I did 13 dumpsters that Saturday by myself and left two empty dumpsters in the dock for Sunday morning. Saturday night a 11:pm he applogized?to me and said they work all over the US and had never dealt with anybody that could keep up with them. I told him I was a man on a mission.

How ever I have had Yodle reduce my add because my business is going so fast thanks to what Yodle has done for me in the past. We generate approximately 160 calls per day when my add is up and running with Yodle. I move approximately 300 dumpsters per month with the way I run my business. I have had to pause my add to be able to handle my phones and take care of the business that we already have. I am 100 % happy with the way my business runs with the add we have. Yodle is a true and honest company and has done wonders with us and I am completely happy with what we have.
